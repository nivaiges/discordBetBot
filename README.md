- **PUUID auto-refresh** — PUUIDs are re-fetched on startup when rotating Riot API keys

## Self-Hosting Guide

Anyone can run their own instance of this bot. You'll need your own Discord bot token and Riot API key (both are free).

### Step 1: Get a Discord Bot Token

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **New Application**, give it a name, and create it
3. Go to the **Bot** tab and click **Reset Token** — copy and save this token
4. Under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, you don't need any special intents
5. Go to **OAuth2 > URL Generator**:
   - Scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`
   - Bot Permissions: `Send Messages`, `Embed Links`, `Read Message History`, `Manage Messages`
6. Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser to invite the bot to your server

### Step 2: Get a Riot API Key

1. Go to [developer.riotgames.com](https://developer.riotgames.com/) and sign in with your Riot account
2. Your **Development API Key** is shown on the dashboard — copy it

> **Note:** Development keys expire every 24 hours and need to be regenerated. For a permanent key, you can [register a production app](https://developer.riotgames.com/app-type), but the development key works fine for personal use.

### Step 3: Install and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nivaiges/discordBetBot.git
cd discordBetBot
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your keys:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
RIOT_API_KEY=your_riot_api_key
RIOT_REGION=na1
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

Set `RIOT_REGION` to your server's platform code:

| Region | Code |
|---|---|
| North America | `na1` |
| EU West | `euw1` |
| EU Nordic & East | `eun1` |
| Korea | `kr` |
| Japan | `jp1` |
| Brazil | `br1` |
| Oceania | `oc1` |
| Latin America North | `la1` |
| Latin America South | `la2` |
| Turkey | `tr1` |
| Russia | `ru` |

Then start the bot:

```bash
npm start
```

For development with auto-restart on file changes:

```bash
npm run start:watch
```

### Step 4: First-Time Setup in Discord

1. Use `/bethere` in the channel where you want betting notifications
2. Use `/adduser YourName#TAG` to start tracking a player
3. When the tracked player enters a ranked game, the bot will automatically post betting buttons

## Updating the Bot

If you downloaded the bot as a ZIP or copied the files manually (no `.git` folder), you'll need to set up git tracking first before you can pull updates.

### If you don't have a `.git` folder

```bash
cd discordBetBot
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/nivaiges/discordBetBot.git
git fetch origin
git reset origin/main
git checkout -- .
npm install
```

This connects your local copy to the repo without overwriting your `.env` or `bot.db` — your config and database are preserved.

### If you already have `.git` set up

```bash
cd discordBetBot
git pull
npm install
```

Then restart the bot. New database columns are added automatically on startup — no data is lost.

### On Raspberry Pi (systemd)

```bash
cd discordBetBot
git pull
npm install
sudo systemctl restart discord-bet-bot
```

## Raspberry Pi Deployment

### Quick Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nivaiges/discordBetBot.git
cd discordBetBot
chmod +x setup-pi.sh
./setup-pi.sh
```

This single script installs Node.js 20, build tools, npm dependencies, creates `.env` from template, and sets up a systemd service with auto-restart on crash and reboot.

After the script runs, edit your `.env` with your keys, then:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart discord-bet-bot
```

### Manual Setup

1. Clone to your Pi
2. Run `npm install` (requires `build-essential` for native SQLite compilation)
3. Copy and fill in `.env`
4. Install the systemd service:

```bash
sudo cp discord-bet-bot.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable --now discord-bet-bot
```

### Useful Commands

```bash
sudo systemctl status discord-bet-bot     # Check status
sudo journalctl -u discord-bet-bot -f     # View logs
sudo systemctl restart discord-bet-bot    # Restart
sudo systemctl stop discord-bet-bot       # Stop
```

The bot will auto-restart on crash (10s delay) or reboot.

## Configuration

Adjustable values in `config.js`:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `collectAmount` | 10,000 | Coins per collect |
| `collectCooldownMs` | 2 hours | Time between collects |
| `pollIntervalMs` | 60,000ms | How often to check for active games |
| `bettingWindowMs` | 300,000ms | Time to place bets after match detection |
| `payoutMultiplier` | 1.5 | Payout multiplier for correct WIN bets |
| `losePayoutMultiplier` | 3 | Payout multiplier for correct LOSE bets |
| `parleyChance` | 0.1 | Chance of parley bet per match (10%) |
| `parleyPayoutMultiplier` | 2 | Payout multiplier for correct parley bets |
| `commandCooldownMs` | 5,000ms | Per-user rate limit between commands |

### Custom Rank Emoji

To show rank icons in bot messages, upload rank images as custom emoji in your Discord server, then fill in the IDs in `config.js`:

```js
rankEmoji: {
  IRON: '<:Iron:123456789>',
  BRONZE: '<:Bronze:123456789>',
  // ...
},
```

To get an emoji ID: type `\:emojiname:` in Discord and send — it shows `<:name:ID>`.

## Riot API Notes

The bot uses two types of Riot API endpoints:

| Endpoint Type | Example Host | Used For |
|---|---|---|
| Platform (region) | `na1.api.riotgames.com` | Spectator, League |
| Regional (continent) | `americas.api.riotgames.com` | Account, Match history |

The bot automatically maps your `RIOT_REGION` to the correct regional endpoint. If you rotate your Riot API key, just update `.env` and restart — PUUIDs are refreshed automatically on startup.
